### Supplementary Material

**MDR_IS_Model.pdf**  
This document presents the full mathematical description of the stochastic population-dynamics model used in the study. It describes each biological process included in the simulations, the corresponding reaction propensities, and the parameterization steps used to match experimental measurements.  

All numerical simulations were implemented in Python using a Google Colab notebook, which contains the complete code for the stochastic model, parameter initialization, and analysis routines. 

## Overview

This repository contains the scripts and notebooks for the stochastic model developed in our study, which explores the evolutionary dynamics of plasmid-bearing and plasmid-free bacterial populations carrying insertion sequences (ISs) under antibiotic selection. The model, based on the Gillespie algorithm, simulates random events of birth, death, mutation (SNPs and ISs), plasmid segregation, and conjugation in a multispecies community competing for a limiting resource.  

Simulations explore how the rate of plasmid conjugation and the structure of transmission networks influence plasmid spread, mutation accumulation, and the shift toward IS-driven evolutionary dynamics.

## Jupyter Notebooks

### [MonodGillespieIS_multispecies.ipynb](MonodGillespieIS_multispecies.ipynb)  
Describes the multispecies stochastic model and shows how birth, death, conjugation, mutation, and segregational loss are implemented under resource limitation.

### [MonodGillespieIS_parametrization.ipynb](MonodGillespieIS_parametrization.ipynb)  
Uses experimental monoculture data to calibrate strain-specific parameters, including Monod growth curves and antibiotic susceptibility from dose–response assays.

### [MonodGillespieIS_conjugation.ipynb](MonodGillespieIS_conjugation.ipynb)  
Simulates plasmid dynamics in a fully connected transfer network while varying the conjugation rate to identify thresholds for plasmid stability and shifts in mutational spectra.

### [MonodGillespieIS_networks.ipynb](MonodGillespieIS_networks.ipynb)  
Explores how reducing connectivity in the plasmid transfer network alters plasmid prevalence and dynamics of SNP- and IS-driven evolution.
